# Contributing

This project is mainly targeted for MarsBased developers 👽 but we love pull request from earthlings too 🌍.

Before contributing make sure that there is not any [issue](https://github.com/MarsBased/pathfinder/issues) already created that covers the same problem / feature that you want to add.

We recommend you to create an issue before starting the development to better organize contributions.

## How to

```git clone git@github.com:your-username/pathfinder.git```

Make your feature addition or bug fix in a featurebranch.

Push your feature branch to GitHub and send us a [Pull Request](https://github.com/marsbased/pathfinder/compare)

Please, include a description of your changes and reference the issue that you are fixing in your commit.
